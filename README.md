# Bon Appétit

Bon Appétit is my personal recipe keepe — a place where I can store, edit, and manage my favorite recipes like a digital cookbook diary.
It helps me easily follow my recipes, keep track of new ones, and update them whenever I want.

This project is built using React with Vite for a fast and smooth development experience.
